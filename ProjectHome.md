<p>This plugin gets to be the only plugin ever made that will connect OkCupid's online messenger to the Pidgin Instant Messaging program (<a href='http://pidgin.im'>http://pidgin.im</a>). It requires json-glib from the <a href='http://pidgin-facebookchat.googlecode.com'>Pidgin-FacebookChat project</a> to work sop please make sure to download it.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <strong>Temujin Ayamikhan</strong> for the custom icons. He worked really hard on rendering these in 3D for us.</p>
